# 🎙️ Text-to-Speech Converter System

This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based Text-to-Speech Converter System** developed using Python.  
It allows users to convert typed or uploaded text (TXT/PDF) into natural-sounding speech using both **offline (pyttsx3)** and **online (gTTS)** engines.  

This project demonstrates the integration of **multi-language support**, **file processing**, and **speech synthesis**, making it a useful application for accessibility, education, and personal productivity.

## 📚 Project Overview

This system combines the flexibility of offline and online text-to-speech systems. The user can select language, speech speed, and voice type, and generate audio either from typed text or uploaded files (including PDFs using PyMuPDF). It’s a complete, standalone tool designed for accessibility, education, or general productivity.
